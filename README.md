Files related to the semantic web and linked data and schemas that I collected for my research and for projects that I worked on. Some of them not easy to locate on the web.

## POWER

"POWER is an ontology of political processes. It is designed for tracking politicians, political organisations and elections, both in mainstream and social media."

As described in:

[POWER - Politics Ontology for Web Entity Retrieval, Moreira](http://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-22056-2_51) ([also here](https://www.davidsbatista.net/assets/documents/publications/workshop_silvio-ontose2011.pdf)), Silvio and Batista, David and Carvalho, Paula and Couto, Francisco M and Silva, MÃ¡rio J, Advanced Information Systems Engineering Workshops, 2011, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

and implemented in:

[Tracking politics with POWER](https://doi.org/10.1108/00330331311313708) Moreira, S., Batista, D.S., Carvalho, P., Couto, F.M. and Silva, M.J. (2013), Program: electronic library and information systems, Vol. 47 No. 2, pp. 120-135. 

This files includes an OWL model of POWER, which I extracted from the larger [dataset of Moreira et. al. (2013) as provided by David Soares Batista](https://github.com/davidsbatista/REACTION-resources/blob/master/PowerBaseline.zip).

I believe the model to be complete, however please let me know, if you know otherwise.
